#learn about ssl and hosting zones and how you will configure it- done
u then need ecs tasks and task defintion etc
also vpc endoint


still need to do 

u then need ecs tasks and task defintion etc
also vpc endoint

waf
blue/green 

iam 
iam role for ecs to pull from ecr and push to cloudwatch
task role to store data in dynamodb for the results of the url's

oidc (this will come later when u do ci/cd)

gateway endpoints: s3 and dynaamodb 
interface endpoints we have:all other services like ecr cloudwtach 

for ecr u need ecr api to actually talk to ecr so u establish connection and then u also need ecr docker to actually pull the image from ecr 

with s3 bucket and dynamodb table
ill need iam for s3 as it needs permison to store and retive data and also iam for dynamodb but vpc endpoint is not needed as its not INSIDE the vpc 

then task needs to store in dyanodb so we need a task role for that
and for the task to talk to an aws service it cant do via gat so we need vpc endpoint and like we said before it will be a gateway endpoint

then ofcourse for ecs to push logs to cloudwtach again thats a service to srvice so we need vpc endpont for that aswell

set up the ecs service configuration wth the alb and figure out how its gonna work 


rn i onlu have 1 target group in my ecs service so lets see how this will work 



do this tomz 
chnage iam role of dynamodb to read and put only 

also if i upgrade my cpu and memory is task definiton i can do it so do that and also add an alarm section in the ecs service (see terra docs)

change cpu and memory of task definiton to normal

the certificate needs to be validated- so see what u can do there -maybe make it in the bootstrap
maybe also look into :  depends_on          = [var.ecstaskrole, var.ecstaskexecutionrole, ecsv2_cluster.name]

add the env in secrets manager =done


ok 
change UI of the app
and codedeploy manually first
